        Steve Wozniak, an Electrical Engineer who co-founded Apple, is known as one of the most important pioneers for Computers in general. He is considered one of the founders of computers because of his early contributions with his co-founded company, Apple. Working together with Steve Jobs they created Personal Computers that were able to be sold, and accessible to anyone who wanted to purchase them. This whole company, and vision started when Steve Wozniak worked as an intern for a homebrew computer company, which specialized with intel's new chip, the Intel Corporation 8080 to create a do-it-yourself kit. After this, Steve Wozniak interned as a Computer Engineer for HP, while he was doing his internship he created his own microcomputer using his own microprocessor, but HP was not interested in his design. Later he met Steve Jobs who also worked at the Homebrew Computer Company, where he then became interested in his design. In the same year they released their first computer. This sparked the “Boom” for electronics in the late 70’s, 80’s, 90’s, 00’s, etc. Without their will to innovate and create at the time, we wouldn’t have the cell phone’s we have today, we wouldn’t have computers accessible to anyone, and it would reduce the modern quality of life significantly. Even though he is credited heavily with the success of the company, it is not known to a majority of apple consumers that Steve Wozniak was the innovator/inventor of the company, while Steve Job’s did a majority of the marketing, and less of the innovative aspects at the time. Steve Wozniak helped create the MOS 6502, which competed with other companies such as Motorola and Intel. The chip was an inexpensive alternative to others at the time, and outperformed its competitors as well.

          Wozniak's development of the Apple I and Apple II computers introduced key features such as the use of a keyboard and color graphics, which set new standards for personal computing and how we still utilize this today. The Apple II, released in 1977, became one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, boosting the growth of the home computer market. His design of the MOS 6502 microprocessor not only made computing more affordable but also contributed to the success of various gaming and educational applications during the early years of the industry.

            Steve Wozniak is credited alongside Steve Jobs with creating the first “Accessible” Personal Computer to ever hit the market. It took them Approximately 3 and a half years to design and construct the computer, alongside its chip, the MOS 6502. It was released in 1976, where they would sell 175-200 units. Just the following year they would release their next product, the Apple II, this model of the Macintosh sold 5-6 Million units, due to its commercial success. It was known as the first widely distributed Microcomputer, which they credit to Apple's current success we see in modern times. Steve Wozniak initially was pulled to create these products, because he wanted to use something that has yet to exist yet, because in his earlier years working at Apple and with Steve Jobs he was widely referred to as an “Innovator”.

            Steve Wozniak designed the single circuit board that was used in the Apple I, making it one of the first fully assembled personal computers. He also introduced color graphics and an open architecture in the Apple II, this offers third-party software development. Excluding physical hardware, he also promoted STEM education, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and different robotics projects. His whole personality, and how he designed the core features and how Apple functions continues to be reflected on how the company acts and works today.
